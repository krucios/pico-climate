# Pico Climate
The indoor air quality monitor device based on Raspberry Pi Pico.

The intent of this project is to create a wireless device capable of periodically report indoor air quality index (IAQ index) alongside with raw data about temperature, humidity and pressure.

High-level requirements:
- Battery powered.
- Time before charges not less than a month (the more the better).
- Wireless and wired conenctivity.
- Reports raw climate data (temperature, humidity, pressure).
- Reports indoor air quality index.
- Reports battery level.
